# ADT_Clock_Merge

What is it?
-----------
At the start of the R2D2 project, two different clock's were created. One as a seperate clock object with TimeStamp and Duration, the other 2 abstract data types named Moment and Duration.
Because this could cause confusion during development, the 2 different clocks had to be merged into one.
The new clock is part of the ADT's. Duration has remained unchanged and Moment has been renamed to TimeStamp.
This project is the merging of the 2 different clocks.
